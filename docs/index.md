We will start off learning about Unity by building a simple prototype of a driving simulator, starting from a set of **assets** that we will download from Github. Through completing this unit you will develop the skills to:
* Work with repositories on GitHub
* Start a new Unity project
* Navigate 3D space and the Unity Editor comfortably
* Add and manipulate objects in a scene to position them where you want, including the camera
* Configure the layout of Unity Editor to suit your needs
* Create simple C# scripts and apply them to objects
* Start using the Visual Studio IDE and become familiar with a few of its basic features
* Add Rigidbody and Collider components to allow objects to collide realistically 
* Declare variables properly and initialize/assign them with appropriate access modifiers
